This software is based on Johnny Lee's WiimoteWhiteboard program (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/).


The application icon and the calibration icons are made by Francisco Cardoso Lima (http://clinik.net/wiimote/).

Other icons are from the Crystal Project (LGPL, http://www.everaldo.com/crystal/).

The Mac OS X JarBundler ANT Task (http://informagen.com/JarBundler/) was used to create the Mac OS X application bundle and to integrate with Apple Help Book.

One-JAR (http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/) was used to create the executable JAR-file for the cross-platform version.
